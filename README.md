When you run the game, it is played on a terminal and you only have to use the keyboard. After choosing the difficulty and the game mode, you can start.    
All the Island details will be shown at each season, so that you can see the treasury or all satisfactions for example. Every answer has to be a number, if you enter a wrong number, the game will ask you to retry.    
It continues until the end of the year, and then a new year will start until you lose...    
You lose when the average satisfaction is under the satisfaction required. In the easy mode, you need more than 10%, in the medium one, more than 25%, and in the hard one, more than 40%.
